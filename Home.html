<h2> What Is an Investment?</h2><br>
<img src="2.jpg" height="150px" width="605px" /> <br>
<ui>An investment is an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation. <br>
    Appreciation refers to an increase in the value of an asset over time. When an individual purchases a good as an investment, <br>
    the intent is not to consume the good but rather to use it in the future to create wealth. <br>
<! -- source of this written conenct: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp />
    An investment always concerns the outlay of some resource today—time, effort, money, <br>
    or an asset—in hopes of a greater payoff in the future than what was originally put in. <br>
 For example, an investor may purchase a monetary asset now with the idea that the asset<br>
 
     will provide income in the future or will later be sold at a higher price for a profit. </ui><br>
